### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Muhammad Osama**](https://osama.dev), a senior software engineer from Toronto üçÅ.

I'm primarily interested in **machine learning and backend systems** and currently work as a
software engineer at [**@Meta**](https://github.com/facebook). Previously, I played a key role in building
the recommendation systems and machine learning platform at [**@Wattpad**](https://github.com/wattpad).

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on systems that see 
tens of thousands of requests per second as well as apps that have 100M+ installs.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following and contributing to AI research. My areas of interest 
primarily include Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems, and Search. 
I also play a lot of video games üéÆ.
