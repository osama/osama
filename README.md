### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="30"/>

I'm [**Muhammad Osama**](https://osama.dev), a senior software engineer and data scientist from 
Toronto <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/3093/3093906.svg" width="12"/>.

I work on recommendation systems and experiences as a leader on the Content Discovery
team at [Wattpad](http://company.wattpad.com/). I am primarily interested in **backend and 
Machine Learning systems** but have also worked extensively on Android and iOS apps in the past.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following and contributing to ML and NLP research, 
particularly in the area of unsupervised machine translation (i.e. translation without paired samples).
I also play a lot of video games <img src="https://image.flaticon.com/icons/svg/686/686589.svg" width="12"/>.
