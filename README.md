### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior software engineer and data scientist currently based in Toronto.

I work on discovery and recommender systems (and related ML & NLP algorithms)
and experiences as a leader on the Content Discovery team at 
[Wattpad](http://company.wattpad.com/).

Outside of work, I'm interested in the rapidly growing area of unsupervised machine translation
(i.e. translation without paired samples). I also play a lot of video games.
